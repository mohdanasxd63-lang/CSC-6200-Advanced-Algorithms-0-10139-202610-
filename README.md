## ðŸ“– Assignment Description  
This project is a warm-up assignment to review arrays in C++.  

**Task:**  
- Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.  
- Each input will have exactly one valid solution.  
- The same element cannot be used twice.  
- The answer may be returned in any order.  

**Examples:**  
```text
Input:  nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  

Input:  nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]  

Input:  nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]
