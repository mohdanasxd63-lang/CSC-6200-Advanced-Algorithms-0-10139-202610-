# Week 4 Project: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** in C++ to find the shortest path in a weighted directed graph. The graph data is hardcoded from the class example (nodes A–E with weighted edges).

## Usage
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ dijkstra.cpp -o dijkstra
Run the executable:

./dijkstra


Enter the start node and end node (A–E).
Example:

Enter start node (A-E): A
Enter end node (A-E): D
Shortest distance from A to D is 5
Path: A -> E -> D
