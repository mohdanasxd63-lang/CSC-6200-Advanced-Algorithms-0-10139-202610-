# Week 6 Project: Huffman Coding

## Overview
This project implements **Huffman Coding** in C++.  
The program builds a Huffman tree from a string of distinct characters and their frequencies, then prints the Huffman codes in preorder traversal.

## Usage
1. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
